# Development Scripts

This directory contains development and maintenance scripts for the Synor project.

## Scripts

### `generate_cli_docs.py`

Automatically generates CLI documentation from the Synor Click commands.

**Usage:**

```sh
python dev/generate_cli_docs.py
```

**What it does:**

- Extracts help messages from all Click commands in `python/synor/cli.py`
- Generates comprehensive Markdown documentation with properly formatted tables
- Saves the output to `docs/docs/core/cli.mdx`
- Only updates the file if content has changed (avoids unnecessary git diffs)
- Automatically escapes HTML-like tags to prevent MDX parsing issues
- Wraps URLs with placeholders in code blocks for proper rendering

**Integration:**

- Runs automatically as a prek hook when `python/synor/cli.py` is modified
- The generated documentation is directly imported into `docs/docs/core/cli.mdx` via MDX import
- Provides seamless single-page CLI documentation experience without separate reference pages

**Dependencies:**

- `md-click` package for extracting Click help information
- `synor` package must be importable (the CLI module)

This ensures that CLI documentation is always kept in sync with the actual command-line interface.

## Type-checking Examples

We provide a helper script to run mypy on each example entry point individually with minimal assumptions about optional dependencies.

### `mypy_check_examples.ps1`

Runs mypy for every `main.py` (and `colpali_main.py`) under the `examples/` folder using these rules:

- Only ignore missing imports (no broad suppressions)
- Avoid type-checking Synor internals by setting `--follow-imports=silent`
- Make Synor sources discoverable via `MYPYPATH=python`

Usage (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File dev/mypy_check_examples.ps1
```

Notes:

- Ensure you have a local virtual environment with `mypy` installed (e.g. `.venv` with `pip install mypy`).
- The script will report any failing example files and exit non-zero on failures.
