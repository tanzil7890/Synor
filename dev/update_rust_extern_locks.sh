# Regenerates Cargo.lock for every isolated Rust workspace that lives outside
# the main workspace — Rust SDK examples and Rust benchmark implementations.
#
# These workspaces depend on the synor SDK via a `path = ...` dependency, so
# whenever the SDK's (transitive) dependencies change, their lockfiles go stale.
# `run_cargo_test_rust_externs.sh` then fails because it runs `cargo test
# --locked`. This script keeps those lockfiles current in place (the same role
# `uv-lock` plays for `uv.lock`); the matching pre-commit hook stages the
# refreshed lockfiles so the `--locked` test passes.
