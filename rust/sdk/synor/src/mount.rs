/// logic identity (`module`, `name`, `code_hash`) and the fingerprint of its
/// non-`ctx` arguments.
///
/// The engine checks this fingerprint *before* running the component
/// (`Component::execute_once` → `memo_key_fingerprint`), so on an unchanged hit
/// the whole component — including child mounts and target-state declaration —
/// is skipped and the previous run is replayed.
///
/// Targets passed as mount arguments fingerprint by their stable key (e.g.
/// `DirTarget` by its directory), so pointing a component at a different output
/// invalidates it while reusing the same output is a hit.
