//! Per-component submit lifecycle on the state-store side: the engine
//! drives Phase 2 (precommit) and Phase 4 (commit / cleanup) through
//! three [`AppStore`] methods — `precommit`, `commit`,
//! `clear_stage_marker`.
//!
//! Spec: [`specs/store/submit_session.md`](../../../../specs/store/submit_session.md).
//!
//! ## Two scopes
//!
//! The lifecycle splits into two **disjoint scopes** with different
//! ownership rules:
//!
//! - **Txn-scoped** — [`PrecommitSession`] is a *value* that lives only
//!   between BEGIN and COMMIT of the precommit txn. Its two methods
//!   (`precommit_read`, `precommit_claim_targets`) are meaningful only
//!   while the txn is open; holding `&mut PrecommitSession` is the
//!   type-level proof of that. Per-attempt mutable state (`paths_to_claim`
//!   stash) lives directly on `&mut self` — no `Mutex`, no `Arc` —
//!   because no other task ever touches it.
//! - **Call-scoped on [`AppStore`]** — `precommit`, `commit`,
//!   `clear_stage_marker` are inherent methods on `AppStore` (the per-app
//!   handle). Each call is a standalone, self-contained operation
//!   parameterized by `component_path` (and, for `clear_stage_marker`,
//!   `process_token`) and opens/closes its own txn(s). No persistent
//!   submit handle threads across the three methods — what ties them
//!   together is the engine code in `engine::execution::submit`, which
//!   calls them with matching args.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! Phase 1 (eager `__cex` upsert) is not an `AppStore`-submit method —
//! see `engine::execution::eager_existence_upsert`, which runs at the
//! start of every Build before the user processor. The `AppStore` owns
//! phases 2 and 4:
//!
//! ```text
//!   [eager_existence_upsert]          ← Phase 1: eager __cex upsert
//!        ↓                              before user processor runs
//!   [user processor runs]
//!        ↓
//!   AppStore::precommit(component_path,
//!     callback(&mut WriteTxn, &mut PrecommitSession) -> Option<(plan, output)>)
//!     ├─ opens batched precommit WTxn (single-writer, coalesced)
//!     ├─ engine callback runs inside it:
//!     │   ├─ session.precommit_read
//!     │   ├─ [engine reconciles in-memory]
//!     │   ├─ session.precommit_claim_targets
//!     │   └─ → Some((plan, output)) | None (PendingRetry)
//!     └─ applies plan writes + commits, or contributes no writes on None.
//!        ↓
//!   [sink_apply runs]
//!        ↓
//!   AppStore::commit(component_path, CommitPlan, reconciler)
//!                                     ← Phase 4 success: open commit txn,
//!                                       apply finalized writes, invoke
//!                                       reconciler for child-existence
//!                                       diff, COMMIT.
//!                                     Or:
//!   AppStore::clear_stage_marker(component_path, process_token)
//!                                     ← Phase 4 failure: clear stage marker.
//!
//!   [Phase 5 + 6 driven separately via AppStore methods — each its own
//!    small txn with no submit-scoped state.]
