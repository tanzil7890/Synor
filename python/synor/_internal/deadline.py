      min-nesting. Expiry raises ``DeadlineExceededError``.

    ``bound_attempt=True``, an in-flight attempt is additionally cancelled
    at the effective deadline via ``asyncio.wait_for`` and surfaces as
    ``DeadlineExceededError``.

    With neither ``max_attempts`` nor a deadline, retries are unbounded;
    this helper is internal and every call site sets at least one limit.
