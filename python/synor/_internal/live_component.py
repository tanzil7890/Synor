# ============================================================================
# `_in_process_live` ContextVar enforcement
# ============================================================================
#
# Per the design (specs/live_component/requirement.md):
#   "process_live() may not call syn.mount() / mount_each() / use_mount() —
#    those create children whose parent_ctx leak from outside the controller,
#    breaking the per-controller cancellation cascade. Use operator.update /
#    operator.delete instead."
#
# Enforcement: a Python `ContextVar` set to `True` for the duration of
# `process_live(operator)`'s asyncio Task. The three mount entry points
# (`syn.mount`, `syn.mount_each`, `syn.use_mount`) check this var and
# raise if set.
#
# Symmetric reset for `process()`: `process()` is invoked from inside
# `update_full()` which is called from `process_live` — so the asyncio
# Task running `process()` would inherit its parent Task's `Context`
# (where `_in_process_live = True`) and `syn.mount(...)` inside `process()`
# would falsely raise. Reset is done inline at the top of
# `LiveComponentOperator.update_full`: we save/restore `_in_process_live`
# around the `update_full_async` call, so the new Task that Rust spawns
# to run `instance.process` snapshots the current `Context` (with `False`)
# at spawn time.
#
# Task-identity invariant (load-bearing, see design.md):
#   `_process_live_wrapper` and the inline reset in `update_full` must
#   execute on asyncio Tasks whose Context was forked from the caller's
#   Context (so the var's value at the wrapper's / reset's `set()` call
#   is visible when the body runs). PyO3's `from_py_future` schedules
#   onto the current event loop without forcing a fresh Context, so the
#   inheritance chain holds. Future-proofing: integration tests verify both:
#     (a) `syn.mount(...)` directly inside `process_live` raises
#     (b) `syn.mount(...)` inside `process()` of a live component does NOT raise
#   If (a) silently stops raising, the wrapper isn't installed; if (b)
#   starts raising, the symmetric reset isn't taking effect — both are
#   load-bearing for the live-component installer machinery.

    Used by `_mount_live_component` (api.py) and the LiveCompClass branch
    of `LiveComponentOperator.update`.

    Live components run independently from the parent update, so parent
    cooperative deadlines do not apply to ``process_live`` or the
    ``operator.update_full()`` calls it starts.

    Save/restore the prior value rather than using `ContextVar.reset(token)`:
    on cancellation the finally block can run in a different `Context`
    than where the Token was created (asyncio Task cancellation can
    swap Contexts during cleanup), and `reset(token)` then raises
    `ValueError("Token was created in a different Context")`. Direct
    `set(prev)` always works because we're mutating whatever the
    current Context is.

    The ``operator._detach()`` in the same finally is the framework's
    fix for a subtle live-mode leak: if user code in ``process_live``
    catches an exception and retains it (``self.last_err = e`` /

    detach, ``App.update``'s ``wait_until_inactive`` poll never observes
    the live component as inactive. After detach, the Rust controller
    drops on schedule; later operator method calls raise. See

    The returned class can be passed to :func:`syn.mount` (and
    :meth:`LiveComponentOperator.update`) wherever a LiveComponent class is
    accepted. Its ``__init__`` accepts the same positional and keyword
    arguments as ``process_fn`` and forwards them to ``process_fn`` on each
    invocation.

    Semantics:

    - ``process()`` calls ``process_fn(*args, **kwargs)``.
    - ``process_live(operator)`` runs ``update_full`` once, ``mark_ready``,
      then loops ``sleep(interval) -> update_full`` with a **fixed delay**
      (the sleep happens after each cycle, so cycles never overlap).
    - In catch-up mode (``live=False``), ``mark_ready`` terminates the live
      component after the first full pass — observationally identical to
      mounting ``process_fn`` directly; the interval is ignored.
    - Cycle exceptions raised inside ``process_fn`` are routed via the
      parent's exception handler chain (same shape as background
      ``syn.mount`` failures — see ``advanced_topics/exception_handlers``).
      ``update_full`` does NOT propagate them to the loop, so the next
      cycle still runs.

    Args:
        process_fn: Async process function — same shape as a function passed
            directly to ``syn.mount``.
        interval: Delay between cycles. Applied between the end of one cycle
            and the start of the next (fixed delay, not fixed rate).

    Example::

        await syn.mount(
            syn.auto_refresh(sync_users, interval=datetime.timedelta(minutes=5)),
            db, target,
