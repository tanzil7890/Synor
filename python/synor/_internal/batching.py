"""Batch splitting: retry a failed batch as smaller batches.

``RetryWithSmallerBatch`` is the control-flow signal a batched function body
(``@syn.task(batching=True)``) raises to tell the engine that the batch failed
in a way that may depend on the batch's composition — e.g. a provider's
per-request token/payload limit, or a single input the provider rejects. The
engine reacts by halving the batch and re-running each half, recursing down
to single items; at size 1 the wrapped original error becomes that item's own
failure. Sub-batches that succeed along the way keep their results, so one
bad input fails only its own caller instead of the whole batch.

The signal is always consumed by the engine — it never propagates to callers.
Raising it is safe for *any* deterministic batch failure: if the error was
actually global (would fail at any size), the recursion terminates at single
items and every caller receives the underlying error, at the bounded cost of
extra attempts (at most ``2n - 1`` for a batch of ``n``). Transient errors
(rate limits, network blips) should first be retried at the same batch size;
once that retry budget is exhausted, splitting is a reasonable last resort —
a smaller request may pass where the large one timed out.
