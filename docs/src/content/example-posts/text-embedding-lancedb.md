This is the Semantic Search 101 example with one thing changed: the vectors land in [LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/) instead of Postgres. LanceDB is an embedded, file-based vector store — no server to stand up, no `POSTGRES_URL`, just a directory on disk you can copy to move. Everything else — read Markdown, chunk, embed each chunk — is identical, so this post focuses on the one part that differs: the connector.

The whole pipeline is ordinary `async` Python and your own types. The heavy lifting — incremental processing, change tracking, managed targets — runs in a Rust engine underneath, so only what changed gets re-embedded and re-upserted.


## Flow overview



From a high level, these are the steps:

1. Read Markdown files from a local directory.
2. Split each file into overlapping chunks, then embed every chunk.
3. Store the chunks and their embeddings in a LanceDB table (as target states).

You declare the transformation logic with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **each work unit declares the outcomes it owns**.

The chunk-and-embed half is unchanged from the base example — `RecursiveSplitter` cuts each file into overlapping Markdown chunks, and a local `SentenceTransformerEmbedder` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, no API key) turns each chunk into a 384-d vector. See the base walkthrough for the chunk/embed details. What changes here is the target.

## Connect to LanceDB

LanceDB is embedded, so the "connection" is just a path on disk — the directory is created on first run. The shared resources the rest of the code builds on are the LanceDB connection and the embedding model, both provided once at startup in `syn.lifespan`. `DocEmbedding` defines one output row — each chunk becomes one row.

```python title="main.py"
import synor as syn
from synor.connectors import lancedb, localfs
from synor.ops.sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformerEmbedder

LANCEDB_URI = "./lancedb_data"
TABLE_NAME = "doc_embeddings"
EMBED_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

LANCE_DB = syn.ContextKey[lancedb.LanceAsyncConnection]("text_embedding_db")
EMBEDDER = syn.ContextKey[SentenceTransformerEmbedder]("embedder", detect_change=True)


@dataclass
class DocEmbedding:
    id: int
    filename: str
    chunk_start: int
    chunk_end: int
    text: str
    embedding: Annotated[NDArray, EMBEDDER]


@syn.lifespan
async def synor_lifespan(builder: syn.EnvironmentBuilder) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    conn = await lancedb.connect_async(LANCEDB_URI)
    builder.provide(LANCE_DB, conn)
    builder.provide(EMBEDDER, SentenceTransformerEmbedder(EMBED_MODEL))
    yield
```

Compared to the Postgres version, the only difference is the resource: `lancedb.connect_async(LANCEDB_URI)` instead of an `asyncpg` pool, and a `LanceAsyncConnection` context key instead of `asyncpg.Pool`. `embedding: Annotated[NDArray, EMBEDDER]` still ties the vector column to the embedder, so its dimensions are inferred automatically — and if you swap the model later, Synor notices (`detect_change=True`) and re-embeds.

## Mount the LanceDB table

`app_main` wires the source to the target. It mounts the LanceDB table, walks the source directory, and mounts one processing component per file.

```python title="main.py"
@syn.task
async def app_main(sourcedir: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    target_table = await lancedb.mount_table_target(
        LANCE_DB,
        table_name=TABLE_NAME,
        table_schema=await lancedb.TableSchema.from_class(
            DocEmbedding, primary_key=["id"]
        ),
    )

    files = localfs.walk_dir(
        sourcedir,
        recursive=True,
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(included_patterns=["**/*.md"]),
        live=True,  # watch for changes; pass -L to `synor update` to run live
    )
    await syn.spawn_each(process_file, files.items(), target_table)
```

`lancedb.mount_table_target` is the LanceDB counterpart to the Postgres `mount_table_target` — same call shape, same managed-table guarantees: it creates and manages the table for you, handles idempotent upserts keyed on the primary key, and cleans up orphan rows when a file disappears. `process_file` and `process_chunk` take a `lancedb.TableTarget[DocEmbedding]` and call `table.ensure_row(...)` exactly as before; only the import changed. `live=True` makes the filesystem source watch for changes, and `spawn_each` runs one component per file.

The App binds it all together and points at the Markdown folder:

```python title="main.py"
app = syn.App(
    syn.AppConfig(name="TextEmbeddingLanceDBV1"),
    app_main,
    sourcedir=pathlib.Path("./markdown_files"),
)
```

## Setup and run

No database to install — LanceDB writes to `./lancedb_data/`, created on first run. Install the example's dependencies and grab a few `.md` files (the repo ships sample files, or drop your own into `markdown_files/`):

```sh
pip install -U "synor[sentence_transformers,lancedb]" python-dotenv
```

Then build and update the index with the `synor` CLI — catch-up (scan, sync, exit) or live (catch up, then keep watching):

```sh
# Catch-up run
synor update main

# Live run: keep watching for file changes
synor update -L main
```

## Query the index

Query with LanceDB's async search API, reusing the *same* embedder from the indexing flow so indexing and querying stay consistent.

```python title="main.py"
async def query_once(conn, embedder, query_text: str, *, top_k: int = TOP_K) -> None:
    query_vec = await embedder.embed(query_text)
    table = await conn.open_table(TABLE_NAME)
    search = await table.search(query_vec, vector_column_name="embedding")
    results = await search.limit(top_k).to_list()
    for r in results:
        score = 1.0 - r["_distance"]
        print(f"[{score:.3f}] {r['filename']}")
        print(f"    {r['text']}")
        print("---")
```

`table.search(...).limit(top_k)` returns the nearest vectors; `_distance` is LanceDB's distance, which we turn into a similarity score. Run a search straight from the command line:

```sh
python main.py "what is self-attention?"
```

The most semantically similar chunks come back ranked — even when they share none of the words in your query.

## Incremental updates

The incremental story is identical to the base example: `@syn.task(cache=True)` decides what to *recompute* (a file is skipped when its content and the function's code are both unchanged), and `lancedb.mount_table_target` decides what to *write* — each row's `id` is derived from its chunk's text, so it upserts only the rows that actually changed and deletes rows whose source is gone.

- **A file is added** — only that file is chunked and embedded, and its rows are inserted.
- **A file is edited** — it is re-chunked; unchanged chunks keep their `id` and embedding, genuinely new chunks are embedded and inserted, and chunks that no longer exist are deleted.
- **A file is deleted** — its rows are removed from the LanceDB table automatically.

A catch-up run (`synor update main`) does this once and exits; live mode (`synor update -L main`) keeps watching and applies each change with low latency.
