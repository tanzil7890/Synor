We'll take a folder of patient intake forms — the messy, multi-section PDFs a clinic hands you on a clipboard — and turn each one into a clean, validated JSON record: demographics, insurance, medications, allergies, surgeries, consent. The hard part isn't reading the PDF; it's getting back data that *matches a schema* every time, so downstream code can trust it. We use [BAML](https://boundaryml.com/) to declare that schema and run a single type-safe extraction per form against a Gemini vision model.

The whole pipeline is ordinary `async` Python. You write a [BAML schema](https://docs.boundaryml.com/) for the `Patient` type and one extraction function, wrap it in a Synor function, and let the Rust engine underneath handle incremental processing — only changed PDFs get re-extracted, and the LLM call (the one genuinely expensive step) is skipped entirely for forms you've already processed.


## Flow overview



From a high level, these are the steps:

1. Read PDF intake forms from a local directory.
2. [Extract a typed `Patient`](https://boundaryml.com/) from each PDF with one BAML function call to a Gemini vision model, then serialize it to JSON.
3. Write one JSON file per form to an output directory (as target states).

You declare the transformation logic with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **each work unit declares the outcomes it owns**.

## Define the schema in BAML

The schema lives in `baml_src/patient.baml`, not in Python. You describe the shape of a patient record as BAML classes — and the same file holds the extraction function and the model client. BAML turns this into a strongly-typed Pydantic client, and at runtime it forces the model's output to conform to the schema (with `"N/A"` filled in for required fields that the form leaves blank).

```baml title="baml_src/patient.baml"
class Patient {
  name string
  dob string
  gender string
  address Address
  phone string
  email string
  preferred_contact_method string
  emergency_contact Contact
  insurance Insurance?
  reason_for_visit string
  symptoms_duration string
  past_conditions Condition[]
  current_medications Medication[]
  allergies Allergy[]
  surgeries Surgery[]
  occupation string?
  pharmacy Pharmacy?
  consent_given bool
  consent_date string?
}

function ExtractPatientInfo(intake_form: pdf) -> Patient {
  client Gemini
  prompt #"
    Extract all patient information from the following intake form document.
    Please be thorough and extract all available information accurately.

    {{ _.role("user") }}
    {{ intake_form }}

    Fill in with "N/A" for required fields if the information is not available.

    {{ ctx.output_format }}
  "#
}
```

The function signature is the contract: `ExtractPatientInfo` takes a `pdf` and returns a `Patient`. `{{ ctx.output_format }}` is where BAML injects the schema into the prompt, and the `Gemini` client (declared in the same file, pointing at `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`) reads PDFs natively as vision input — no separate parse or OCR step. Nested types like `Address`, `Insurance`, and the `Condition[]` / `Medication[]` lists are defined the same way; see the full `patient.baml` in the repo.

Running `baml generate` compiles this into a `baml_client/` package you import from Python — `b.ExtractPatientInfo(...)` and the `Patient` Pydantic model.

## Wrap BAML in a Synor function

`extract_patient_info` is the single transform: PDF bytes in, a typed `Patient` out. BAML's `baml_py.Pdf.from_base64` takes the raw bytes, and the generated `b.ExtractPatientInfo` does the typed extraction.

```python title="main.py"
import base64
import pathlib

import synor as syn
from synor.resources.file import FileLike, PatternFilePathMatcher
from synor.connectors import localfs
from baml_client import b
from baml_client.types import Patient
import baml_py


@syn.task
async def extract_patient_info(content: bytes) -> Patient:
    """Extract patient information from PDF content using BAML."""
    pdf = baml_py.Pdf.from_base64(base64.b64encode(content).decode("utf-8"))
    return await b.ExtractPatientInfo(pdf)
```

The return type is `Patient` — the actual Pydantic class BAML generated, not a dict — so everything downstream is typed and validated. There's no prompt engineering or response parsing here; that all lives in the BAML schema, and the LLM call is one `await`.

## Process a file



`process_patient_form` runs once per PDF. It reads the file, runs the BAML extraction, dumps the typed `Patient` to JSON, and declares one output file named after the source form.

```python title="main.py"
@syn.task(cache=True)
async def process_patient_form(file: FileLike, outdir: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    """Process a patient intake form PDF and extract structured information."""
    content = await file.read()
    patient_info = await extract_patient_info(content)
    patient_json = patient_info.model_dump_json(indent=2)
    output_filename = file.file_path.path.stem + ".json"
    localfs.ensure_file(
        outdir / output_filename, patient_json, create_parent_dirs=True
    )
```

`@syn.task` with `cache=True` is what makes this incremental: if a PDF's content and this function's code are both unchanged, the whole file is skipped on the next run — so you never pay for a second Gemini call on a form you've already extracted. `patient_info.model_dump_json(indent=2)` serializes the validated model, and `localfs.ensure_file` declares the JSON file as a target state; Synor handles writing, updating, or deleting it to match.

## Define the main function

`app_main` wires the source to the target. It walks the source directory for PDFs and mounts one processing component per file with `spawn_each`.

```python title="main.py"
@syn.task
async def app_main(sourcedir: pathlib.Path, outdir: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    """Main application function that processes patient intake forms."""
    files = localfs.walk_dir(
        sourcedir,
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(included_patterns=["**/*.pdf"]),
    )
    await syn.spawn_each(process_patient_form, files.items(), outdir)


app = syn.App(
    syn.AppConfig(name="PatientIntakeExtractionBaml"),
    app_main,
    sourcedir=pathlib.Path("./data/patient_forms"),
    outdir=pathlib.Path("./output_patients"),
)
```

The filesystem source walks `data/patient_forms/` for `*.pdf`, and `spawn_each` runs one component per form so the engine can track and update each independently. `syn.App` binds the main function to its arguments — the source and output directories — into a runnable unit.

## Setup

- Install Synor and the dependencies this example uses (BAML ships the client generator and the Python runtime):

  ```sh
  pip install -U synor baml-py pydantic python-dotenv
  ```

- Generate the BAML client from the schema. This compiles `baml_src/patient.baml` into the `baml_client/` package that `main.py` imports:

  ```sh
  baml generate
  ```

- The extraction uses a Gemini vision model. Put your key in a `.env` file in the example directory (it's auto-loaded when you run):

  ```sh
  echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
  ```

- A few intake forms to extract. The example ships a `data/patient_forms/` folder with a handful of artificial PDFs — or drop your own in.

## Run the pipeline

Run the `synor` CLI to build and update the index. A catch-up run scans the source, extracts, writes, and exits:

```sh
synor update main.py
```

This reads each PDF in `data/patient_forms/`, extracts a `Patient`, and writes one JSON file per form to `output_patients/`. Check the output:

```sh
ls output_patients/
# Patient_Intake_Form_David_Artificial.json
# Patient_Intake_Form_Emily_Artificial.json
# ...one .json per intake PDF
```

Each file is a fully populated, schema-validated patient record — the same shape every time, ready to load into a database, a chart, or another pipeline.

## Incremental updates

Synor keeps the output in sync with your intake forms and does the **minimum work** to get there. You never compute a diff or write update logic. Two pieces make this work. `@syn.task(cache=True)` decides what to *recompute* — a form is skipped when its bytes and the function's code are both unchanged, so Gemini never re-extracts an unchanged PDF. `localfs.ensure_file` decides what to *write* — the engine compares declared output files against what's on disk and applies only the difference.

- **A form is added** — only that PDF is extracted; its JSON file is written. The rest is untouched.
- **A form is replaced** — it is re-extracted and its JSON file is rewritten; every other form is left alone.
- **A form is deleted** — its JSON file is removed from the output directory automatically.

The same machinery covers **logic** changes too: edit the BAML schema (add a field, tighten a type) or swap the model, run `baml generate` again, and the next `synor update main.py` re-extracts and rewrites — applying only the difference against what's already there.

## Run it

The full, runnable example is in this local workspace: examples/patient_intake_extraction_baml. The exact same task — intake PDFs to a typed `Patient` — has a DSPy twin that swaps BAML for a DSPy signature and module, so you can compare the two structured-extraction libraries side by side on one flow.
