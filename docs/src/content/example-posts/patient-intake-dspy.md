We'll take a folder of patient intake PDFs — names, addresses, insurance, medications, allergies, consent — and turn each one into a clean, validated JSON record. The hard part isn't the file plumbing; it's that intake forms are *visual*: checkboxes, hand-filled fields, tables of medications. So instead of extracting text, we render each PDF page to an image and let a vision model read the form the way a person would. [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) handles the prompting — you declare a typed `Signature` and it produces a [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) `Patient`, no prompt strings to hand-tune.

The whole pipeline is ordinary `async` Python and your own types. The heavy lifting — incremental processing, change tracking, managed targets — runs in a Rust engine underneath, so only changed forms get re-extracted, and each one becomes exactly one JSON file on disk.


## Flow overview



From a high level, these are the steps:

1. Read PDF intake forms from a local directory.
2. [Render each page to an image](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) with PyMuPDF, then extract a typed `Patient` with a [DSPy `ChainOfThought`](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) vision module on Gemini.
3. Write one JSON file per form to a local directory (as target states).

You declare the transformation logic with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **each work unit declares the outcomes it owns**.

## Setup

- A [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) — the extraction runs on a Gemini vision model. The example auto-loads a `.env` file:

  ```sh
  echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
  ```

- Install Synor and the dependencies this example uses (DSPy for the extraction, PyMuPDF to rasterize PDFs, Pillow for the image bytes DSPy passes along):

  ```sh
  pip install -U synor dspy-ai pymupdf pillow pydantic python-dotenv
  ```

- A few intake PDFs to extract. The example ships a `data/patient_forms/` folder with a handful of artificial forms — or drop your own in.

## Define the output schema

The output is just Python types. `Patient` is a Pydantic model that describes everything we want off the form, with nested models for the pieces that have structure of their own — address, insurance, medications, allergies, surgeries. This *is* the contract: DSPy fills it in, Pydantic validates it, and it serializes straight to JSON.

```python title="models.py"
class Address(BaseModel):
    street: str
    city: str
    state: str
    zip_code: str


class Medication(BaseModel):
    name: str
    dosage: str


class Patient(BaseModel):
    """Complete patient information extracted from intake form."""

    name: str
    dob: datetime.date
    gender: str
    address: Address
    phone: str
    email: str
    emergency_contact: Contact
    insurance: Insurance | None = None
    reason_for_visit: str
    past_conditions: list[Condition] = Field(default_factory=list)
    current_medications: list[Medication] = Field(default_factory=list)
    allergies: list[Allergy] = Field(default_factory=list)
    surgeries: list[Surgery] = Field(default_factory=list)
    consent_given: bool
    consent_date: str | None = None
```

Optional fields (`insurance`, `consent_date`) and `default_factory=list` collections mean a form that doesn't mention medications produces an empty list, not a failure — the model bends to whatever the form actually contains.

## Declare the extraction with DSPy

Rather than write a prompt, you declare a [DSPy `Signature`](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy): a list of form-page images comes in, a typed `Patient` comes out. `ChainOfThought` wraps it so the model reasons before it answers, which helps on dense, checkbox-heavy forms. DSPy compiles the typed in/out into the actual prompt for you.

```python title="main.py"
class PatientExtractionSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract structured patient information from a medical intake form image."""

    form_images: list[dspy.Image] = dspy.InputField(
        desc="Images of the patient intake form pages"
    )
    patient: Patient = dspy.OutputField(
        desc="Extracted patient information with all available fields filled"
    )


class PatientExtractor(dspy.Module):
    """DSPy module for extracting patient information from intake form images."""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.extract = dspy.ChainOfThought(PatientExtractionSignature)

    def forward(self, form_images: list[dspy.Image]) -> Patient:
        result = self.extract(form_images=form_images)
        return result.patient
```

The model is configured once at module load — `dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM("gemini/gemini-2.5-flash"))` — so the same vision LM is reused for every form. Because the `OutputField` is typed as `Patient`, DSPy asks the model for that exact shape and hands you back a validated Pydantic object, not a string to parse.

## Render the PDF and extract

`extract_patient` is the one custom transform. It rasterizes every page of the PDF to a PNG with PyMuPDF (at 2× scale, so small print stays legible), wraps each page as a `dspy.Image`, and runs the extractor. No text extraction, no Markdown conversion — the model reads the rendered form directly.

```python title="main.py"
@syn.fn
def extract_patient(pdf_content: bytes) -> Patient:
    """Extract patient information from PDF content."""
    pdf_doc = pymupdf.open(stream=pdf_content, filetype="pdf")

    form_images = []
    for page in pdf_doc:
        pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=pymupdf.Matrix(2, 2))
        img_bytes = pix.tobytes("png")
        form_images.append(dspy.Image(img_bytes))

    pdf_doc.close()

    extractor = PatientExtractor()
    patient = extractor(form_images=form_images)
    return patient
```

`@syn.fn` makes this a Synor function so the engine can track it. Rendering at `Matrix(2, 2)` matters: forms are full of small, hand-entered text, and the extra resolution is the difference between the model reading a zip code and guessing one.

## Process a file



`process_patient_form` runs once per PDF. It reads the file's bytes, extracts the `Patient`, serializes it to pretty-printed JSON, and declares one output file named after the source form.

```python title="main.py"
@syn.fn(memo=True)
async def process_patient_form(file: FileLike, outdir: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    """Process a patient intake form PDF and extract structured information."""
    content = await file.read()
    patient_info = extract_patient(content)
    patient_json = patient_info.model_dump_json(indent=2)
    output_filename = file.file_path.path.stem + ".json"
    localfs.declare_file(
        outdir / output_filename, patient_json, create_parent_dirs=True
    )
```

`@syn.fn` with `memo=True` is what makes this incremental: if a form's content and this function's code are both unchanged, the whole file is skipped on the next run — so you never re-run the (paid, slow) vision extraction on a form you've already processed. `localfs.declare_file` declares the JSON as a target state; Synor writes, rewrites, or deletes it to match.

## Define the main function

`app_main` wires the source to the target. It walks the source directory for PDFs and mounts one processing component per file.

```python title="main.py"
@syn.fn
async def app_main(sourcedir: pathlib.Path, outdir: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    """Main application function that processes patient intake forms."""
    files = localfs.walk_dir(
        sourcedir,
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(included_patterns=["**/*.pdf"]),
    )
    await syn.mount_each(process_patient_form, files.items(), outdir)


app = syn.App(
    syn.AppConfig(name="PatientIntakeExtractionDSPy"),
    app_main,
    sourcedir=pathlib.Path("./data/patient_forms"),
    outdir=pathlib.Path("./output_patients"),
)
```

`walk_dir` scans the filesystem source for `*.pdf` files, and `mount_each` runs one component per file so the engine can track and update them independently. Each component owns exactly one output JSON, so the mapping from form to record is one-to-one — and when a form disappears, its JSON is cleaned up automatically.

## Run the pipeline

Run the `synor` CLI to build the index — scan the forms, extract, write the JSON files, and exit:

```sh
synor update main.py
```

Each PDF in `data/patient_forms/` becomes a JSON file in `output_patients/`, named after the source form:

```sh
ls output_patients/
# Patient_Intake_Form_David_Artificial.json
# Patient_Intake_Form_Emily_Artificial.json
# ...
```

Open one and you'll see the full `Patient` record — name, date of birth, address, insurance, the medication and allergy lists, consent — extracted straight from the rendered form and validated against the schema.

## Incremental updates

Synor keeps the output JSON in sync with your forms and does the **minimum work** to get there. You never compute a diff or write update logic. Two pieces make this work. `@syn.fn(memo=True)` decides what to *recompute* — a form is skipped when its bytes and the function's code are both unchanged, so the vision model never re-reads a form you've already extracted. `mount_each` decides what to *write* — each component owns one JSON file, so the engine creates, rewrites, or deletes exactly the files that changed.

- **A form is added** — only that PDF is rendered and extracted; its JSON is written. The rest is untouched.
- **A form is replaced** — it is re-rendered and re-extracted, and its single JSON is rewritten.
- **A form is deleted** — its JSON is removed from the output directory automatically.

The same machinery covers **logic** changes too: add a field to the `Patient` model or switch the LM, and Synor re-runs the extraction and rewrites the affected JSON. A catch-up run (`synor update main.py`) does this once and exits.

## Run it

The full, runnable example is in this local workspace: examples/patient_intake_extraction_dspy. Prefer to define your schema and extraction in a typed DSL instead of Python? The twin example Patient Intake Extraction with BAML runs the exact same flow with [BAML](https://boundaryml.com/) doing the extraction.
