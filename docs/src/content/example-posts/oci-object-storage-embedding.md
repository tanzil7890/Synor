This is the Semantic Search 101 example with exactly one thing changed: instead of reading Markdown from a local folder, it lists Markdown objects from an Oracle Cloud (OCI) Object Storage bucket. The chunk → embed → store-in-pgvector half is identical, so the base walkthrough covers the embedding model, the `DocEmbedding` row, and the query. Here we focus on the part that differs: the OCI client, the source call, and how the same flow goes **live** off OCI Streaming.


## Flow overview



From a high level, these are the steps:

1. List Markdown objects from an OCI Object Storage bucket (optionally under a prefix).
2. Split each object into overlapping chunks, then embed every chunk.
3. Store the chunks and their embeddings in Postgres (as target states).

You declare the transformation logic with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **each work unit declares the outcomes it owns**.

## Provide the OCI client

The OCI SDK is synchronous and you create the client yourself, so we build one from a config-file profile and hand it to the context alongside the Postgres pool and the embedder. The connector wraps every SDK call in `asyncio.to_thread`, so passing the sync client through is fine.

```python title="main.py"
def _build_oci_client() -> ObjectStorageClient:
    config = oci.config.from_file(
        file_location=os.path.expanduser(OCI_CONFIG_FILE),
        profile_name=OCI_PROFILE,
    )
    return ObjectStorageClient(config)


OCI_CLIENT = syn.ContextKey[ObjectStorageClient]("oci_object_storage_client")


@syn.lifespan
async def synor_lifespan(builder: syn.EnvironmentBuilder) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    async with asyncpg.create_pool(DATABASE_URL) as pool:
        builder.provide(PG_DB, pool)
        builder.provide(EMBEDDER, SentenceTransformerEmbedder(EMBED_MODEL))
        builder.provide(OCI_CLIENT, _build_oci_client())
        yield
```

Everything downstream of this — `DocEmbedding`, `process_file`, `process_chunk` — is the same chunk-and-embed code as the base example, so we won't repeat it here. The one small difference is the source type: `process_file` takes an `oci_object_storage.OCIFile` and reads its text with `await file.read_text()`, just like the local `FileLike`.

## List objects from the bucket

`app_main` mounts the Postgres table, then walks the bucket with `list_objects`. It is the OCI analogue of `localfs.walk_dir` — give it the client, the namespace, the bucket, an optional prefix, and a path matcher, and it yields one `OCIFile` per matching object.

```python title="main.py"
@syn.fn
async def app_main() -> None:
    target_table = await postgres.mount_table_target(
        PG_DB,
        table_name=TABLE_NAME,
        table_schema=await postgres.TableSchema.from_class(
            DocEmbedding, primary_key=["id"],
        ),
        pg_schema_name=PG_SCHEMA_NAME,
    )

    client = syn.use_context(OCI_CLIENT)

    # Live mode is opt-in: build a LiveStream[bytes] from OCI Streaming if configured.
    consumer = _build_streaming_consumer()
    live_stream = None
    if consumer is not None and OCI_STREAMING_TOPIC is not None:
        live_stream = kafka.topic_as_stream(consumer, [OCI_STREAMING_TOPIC]).payloads()

    files = oci_object_storage.list_objects(
        client,
        OCI_NAMESPACE,
        OCI_BUCKET,
        prefix=OCI_PREFIX,
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(included_patterns=["**/*.md"]),
        live_stream=live_stream,
    )
    await syn.mount_each(process_file, files.items(), target_table)
```

`mount_each` runs one processing component per object so the engine tracks and updates each independently. With `live_stream=None` (the default), `list_objects` does a one-shot catch-up scan. Pass a stream and it keeps watching — that's the next section.

## Live mode via OCI Streaming

OCI Streaming is Kafka-protocol-compatible, so live updates ride the Kafka connector. When the four `OCI_STREAMING_*` env vars are set, we build a `confluent_kafka.aio.AIOConsumer` with `SASL_SSL` + `PLAIN` auth, wrap it with `kafka.topic_as_stream(...).payloads()` to get a `LiveStream[bytes]`, and pass it to `list_objects`. The connector snapshots a cutoff before the scan, runs the scan and stream concurrently, and for each post-cutoff event re-reads the object to apply an authoritative update or delete — see the OCI Object Storage connector docs for the details.

```python title="main.py"
def _build_streaming_consumer() -> AIOConsumer | None:
    if not (
        OCI_STREAMING_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS and OCI_STREAMING_TOPIC
        and OCI_STREAMING_USERNAME and OCI_STREAMING_AUTH_TOKEN
    ):
        return None
    return AIOConsumer({
        "bootstrap.servers": OCI_STREAMING_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS,
        "security.protocol": "SASL_SSL",
        "sasl.mechanism": "PLAIN",
        "sasl.username": OCI_STREAMING_USERNAME,
        "sasl.password": OCI_STREAMING_AUTH_TOKEN,
        "group.id": OCI_STREAMING_GROUP_ID,
        "auto.offset.reset": "earliest",
        "enable.auto.commit": False,
    })
```

## Setup and run

- A running Postgres with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension:

  ```sh
  export POSTGRES_URL="postgres://synor:synor@localhost/synor"
  ```

- An OCI Object Storage bucket with Markdown objects, and an [OCI config file](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) (default `~/.oci/config`) with API-key auth. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `OCI_NAMESPACE`, `OCI_BUCKET`, and an optional `OCI_PREFIX`.

- Install Synor with the OCI, Kafka, Postgres, and embedding extras:

  ```sh
  pip install -U "synor[oci,kafka,postgres,sentence_transformers]" asyncpg pgvector numpy python-dotenv
  ```

Build the index — catch-up (scan, sync, exit) or live (catch up, then keep watching the OCI Streaming topic):

```sh
# Catch-up run
synor update main

# Live run: keep watching OCI Streaming for change events
synor update -L main
```

Then search straight from the command line:

```sh
python main.py "what is self-attention?"
```

This example keeps it minimal and doesn't declare a vector index, so queries do a sequential scan — fine for a few objects. For a larger corpus, add `target_table.declare_vector_index(column="embedding")` exactly as Semantic Search 101 does.

## Incremental updates

Incrementality works the same as the base example: `@syn.fn(memo=True)` skips an object whose content and code are unchanged, and `mount_table_target` upserts only the rows that actually changed and deletes rows whose source is gone.

- **An object is added** — only that object is chunked and embedded; its rows are inserted.
- **An object is updated** — it is re-chunked; unchanged chunks keep their `id` and embedding, new chunks are embedded and inserted, and vanished chunks are deleted.
- **An object is deleted** — its rows are removed from the target automatically.

In catch-up mode Synor discovers these by re-scanning the bucket; in live mode the OCI Streaming events drive the same updates with low latency, no full re-scan needed.

## Run it

The full, runnable example is in this local workspace: examples/oci_object_storage_embedding. If you're starting from a local folder instead of a bucket, Semantic Search 101 is the same flow on the local filesystem.
