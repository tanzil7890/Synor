A pile of product listings has the recommendations hiding in plain sight — a *pen* pairs with *ink refills* and a *notebook*; a *monitor* pairs with a *stand* and an *HDMI cable*. But that knowledge is locked in prose. In this tutorial we'll build a Synor pipeline that turns a folder of product JSON into a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph: an LLM tags each product with what it *is* and what *complements* it, and the shared taxonomy nodes turn into a recommendation engine you can query in Cypher.

The whole pipeline is ordinary `async` Python and your own types. The heavy lifting — incremental processing, change tracking, managed graph targets — runs in a Rust engine underneath, so editing one product re-extracts only that product and the graph reconciles itself.


## What we're building

Two node types, two relationship types:

- **`Product`** nodes — one per listing (title, price).
- **`Taxonomy`** nodes — one per distinct label (`gel pen`, `notebook`, `ink refill`), keyed by value and *shared* across products.
- **`PRODUCT_TAXONOMY`** edges — `Product → Taxonomy`: what the product is.
- **`PRODUCT_COMPLEMENTARY_TAXONOMY`** edges — `Product → Taxonomy`: what a buyer might also need.

The recommendation falls out of the graph: products whose *complementary* taxonomy matches another product's *is-a* taxonomy are things to recommend together.

## Pipeline overview



The taxonomy labels are shared across products, so — like the docs knowledge graph — the pipeline runs in two phases:

1. **Per-product extraction.** For each product, render its details to Markdown, LLM-extract the taxonomies and complementary taxonomies, declare the `Product` node, and carry the labels forward.
2. **Graph building.** One pass declares the deduplicated `Taxonomy` nodes and the two relationship types across all products.

You declare the transformation with native Python; Synor works out what to insert, update, and delete. Think: **each work unit declares the outcomes it owns**.

## LLM taxonomy extraction

The extraction schema is two lists, and the field descriptions do the prompting — "what it is" vs. "what pairs with it":

```python title="main.py"
class ProductTaxonomy(pydantic.BaseModel):
    name: str = pydantic.Field(
        description="A concise noun for the product's core functionality — lowercase, "
        "specific ('pen', 'printer'), not broad ('office supplies')."
    )


class ProductTaxonomyInfo(pydantic.BaseModel):
    taxonomies: list[ProductTaxonomy] = pydantic.Field(description="What this product is.")
    complementary_taxonomies: list[ProductTaxonomy] = pydantic.Field(
        description="Taxonomies for complementary products a buyer might also need."
    )


@syn.fn(memo=True)
async def extract_taxonomy(detail: str) -> ProductTaxonomyInfo:
    client = instructor.from_litellm(litellm.acompletion, mode=instructor.Mode.JSON)
    result = await client.chat.completions.create(
        model=syn.use_context(LLM_MODEL),
        response_model=ProductTaxonomyInfo,
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": TAXONOMY_PROMPT}, {"role": "user", "content": detail}],
    )
    return ProductTaxonomyInfo.model_validate(result.model_dump())
```

Extraction is [instructor](https://github.com/instructor-ai/instructor) over [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/) — swap `LLM_MODEL` for any provider. `@syn.fn(memo=True)` caches each extraction by content, so re-running re-tags only changed products.

## Phase 1: per-product extraction

`process_file` renders the product JSON to Markdown (a Jinja template), declares the `Product` node, extracts the taxonomies, and returns the labels for phase 2:

```python title="main.py"
@syn.fn(memo=True)
async def process_file(file: FileLike, product_table: neo4j.TableTarget[Product]) -> ProductTaxonomies:
    raw = json.loads(await file.read_text())
    product_id = file.file_path.path.name.removesuffix(".json")
    price = float(str(raw["price"]).lstrip("$").replace(",", ""))
    product_table.declare_record(row=Product(id=product_id, title=raw["title"], price=price))

    info = await extract_taxonomy(PRODUCT_TEMPLATE.render(**raw))
    return ProductTaxonomies(
        product_id=product_id,
        taxonomies=[t.name for t in info.taxonomies],
        complementary=[t.name for t in info.complementary_taxonomies],
    )
```

## Phase 2: build the graph

`Taxonomy` nodes are shared, so they're owned by one graph pass — it declares the deduplicated node set and the two relationship types:

```python title="main.py"
@syn.fn
async def build_graph(products, taxonomy_table, product_taxonomy_rel, complementary_rel) -> None:
    labels = {t for p in products for t in (*p.taxonomies, *p.complementary)}
    for value in labels:
        taxonomy_table.declare_record(row=Taxonomy(value=value))

    for p in products:
        for t in set(p.taxonomies):
            product_taxonomy_rel.declare_relation(from_id=p.product_id, to_id=t)
        for t in set(p.complementary):
            complementary_rel.declare_relation(from_id=p.product_id, to_id=t)
```

Both relationship types carry no payload, so the Neo4j connector derives each edge's identity from its `(Product, Taxonomy)` endpoints — one edge per pair, no duplicates.

## Run the pipeline

```sh
docker run -d -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/synor --name synor-neo4j neo4j:5.26-community
cp .env.example .env   # set OPENAI_API_KEY (or LLM_MODEL=ollama/llama3.2)
pip install -e .
synor update main
```

The example ships a `products/` folder of sample listings (pens, notebooks, monitors, …). Running it builds the graph — on the 9 sample products that's **9 `Product` nodes, ~40 `Taxonomy` nodes**, and the two edge types wired up.

## Explore the recommendations

Open [Neo4j Browser](http://localhost:7474) (`neo4j` / `synor`) and ask the graph for recommendations:

```cypher
// What a pen is, and what pairs with it
MATCH (p:Product)-[:PRODUCT_TAXONOMY]->(:Taxonomy {value: "gel pen"})
MATCH (p)-[:PRODUCT_COMPLEMENTARY_TAXONOMY]->(c:Taxonomy)
RETURN p.title, collect(c.value) AS also_needs

// Recommend products to pair with anything that is a "pen":
// find products whose *is-a* taxonomy matches a pen's *complementary* taxonomy
MATCH (:Taxonomy {value: "gel pen"})<-[:PRODUCT_TAXONOMY]-(:Product)
      -[:PRODUCT_COMPLEMENTARY_TAXONOMY]->(need:Taxonomy)
MATCH (rec:Product)-[:PRODUCT_TAXONOMY]->(need)
RETURN DISTINCT rec.title
```

On the sample data, recommending for a pen surfaces the notepad and the multipurpose paper — exactly the cross-sell you'd want.

## Incremental updates

- **Edit a product** — only that product re-extracts; the graph pass re-runs and diffs, adding new taxonomy nodes/edges and removing ones no longer supported anywhere.
- **Add a product** — one extraction plus the graph diff.
- **Delete a product** — its `Product` node and edges are cleaned up; taxonomies only it introduced disappear on the next pass.
- **Swap the LLM** — `LLM_MODEL` has `detect_change=True`, so changing it re-extracts everything against the new model with no cache to clear.
