We'll take a folder of images and make it searchable in plain English — type *"long neck"* and get the giraffe back, with no tags, no captions, no manual labeling. The trick is [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip): it embeds images **and** text into the *same* vector space, so a text query and a matching picture land near each other. We store the image vectors in [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) and serve search through a small FastAPI + React app.

The whole pipeline is ordinary `async` Python and your own types. The heavy lifting — incremental processing, change tracking, the managed Qdrant collection — runs in a Rust engine underneath, and the flow runs in live mode inside the API server, so dropping a new photo into the folder updates the index within a second.


## Flow overview



The indexing path is short — there's no text to chunk, just one embedding per image:

1. Read image files from a local directory (live).
2. Embed each image with the [CLIP](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14) image encoder.
3. Store the vector in Qdrant (as a point, keyed by a stable id, with the filename in the payload).

You declare the transformation logic with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **each work unit declares the outcomes it owns**.

## One embedding space for images and text

This is the idea the whole example rests on. CLIP was trained to pull an image and its caption *together* in vector space, so the image of a giraffe and the words "long neck" end up close — even though one is pixels and the other is text. That means **indexing and querying use the same model, two different encoders**:

```python title="pipeline.py"
@functools.cache
def get_clip_model() -> tuple[CLIPModel, CLIPProcessor]:
    model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(CLIP_MODEL_NAME)       # openai/clip-vit-large-patch14
    processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(CLIP_MODEL_NAME)
    return model, processor


def embed_image_bytes(img_bytes: bytes) -> list[float]:     # indexing side
    model, processor = get_clip_model()
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(img_bytes)).convert("RGB")
    inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        out = model.get_image_features(**inputs)
    return _projected_features(out)[0].tolist()


def embed_query(text: str) -> list[float]:                  # query side
    model, processor = get_clip_model()
    inputs = processor(text=[text], return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
    with torch.no_grad():
        out = model.get_text_features(**inputs)
    return _projected_features(out)[0].tolist()
```

Both produce a 768-d vector in the same space, so a cosine search with a text vector finds the nearest *image* vectors. `@functools.cache` loads the (large) CLIP model once and reuses it for every image and every query.

## Setup

- A running [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/):

  ```sh
  docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
  export QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6334/"
  ```

- Install Synor and the dependencies this example uses:

  ```sh
  pip install -U "synor[qdrant]" torch transformers pillow fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" python-dotenv
  ```

- A few images. The example ships an `img/` folder (a cat, a dog, an elephant, a giraffe) — or drop your own `.jpg` / `.png` files in.

## Shared resources: the Qdrant client

The lifespan provides the Qdrant client once at startup, via a context key:

```python title="pipeline.py"
QDRANT_DB = syn.ContextKey[QdrantClient]("image_search_qdrant")


@syn.lifespan
async def synor_lifespan(builder: syn.EnvironmentBuilder) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    client = qdrant.create_client(qdrant_url(), prefer_grpc=True)
    builder.provide(QDRANT_DB, client)
    yield
```

## Process an image



`process_file` runs once per image: read the bytes, embed with CLIP, and declare a Qdrant point keyed by a stable id derived from the path, with the filename in the payload.

```python title="pipeline.py"
@syn.fn(memo=True)
async def process_file(file: FileLike, target: qdrant.CollectionTarget) -> None:
    content = await file.read()
    embedding = embed_image_bytes(content)
    point = qdrant.PointStruct(
        id=_image_id(file.file_path.path),                  # uuid5 of the path — stable
        vector=embedding,
        payload={"filename": str(file.file_path.path)},
    )
    target.declare_point(point)
```

`@syn.fn(memo=True)` makes it incremental: an unchanged image is never re-embedded. Each image runs as its own processing component, so the engine tracks them independently — delete an image and its point is removed from Qdrant automatically. `declare_point` declares the point as a target state; Synor upserts or deletes to match.

## Define the main function

`app_main` mounts the Qdrant collection — sizing the vector to CLIP's projection dimension and using cosine distance — then walks the image folder and mounts one component per file:

```python title="pipeline.py"
@syn.fn
async def app_main(sourcedir: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    model, _ = get_clip_model()
    dim = model.config.projection_dim   # 768 for ViT-L/14

    target_collection = await qdrant.mount_collection_target(
        QDRANT_DB,
        collection_name=QDRANT_COLLECTION,   # "ImageSearch"
        schema=await qdrant.CollectionSchema.create(
            vectors=qdrant.QdrantVectorDef(
                schema=VectorSchema(dtype=np.dtype(np.float32), size=dim),
                distance="cosine",
            )
        ),
    )

    files = localfs.walk_dir(
        sourcedir,
        recursive=True,
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(
            included_patterns=["**/*.jpg", "**/*.jpeg", "**/*.png"]
        ),
        live=True,   # api.py runs the app with live=True
    )
    await syn.mount_each(process_file, files.items(), target_collection)


app = syn.App(
    syn.AppConfig(name="ImageSearchQdrantV1"),
    app_main,
    sourcedir=pathlib.Path("./img"),
)
```

`mount_collection_target` creates and manages the Qdrant collection for you — schema, idempotent upserts, and cleanup when an image disappears. The vector size comes straight from the model, so swapping CLIP variants just works.

## Run it as a service

Unlike the batch examples, image search runs as a server. `api.py` is a FastAPI app whose [lifespan](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/) starts the Synor flow in **live mode** in the background — it blocks startup until the initial sweep finishes (so the collection is queryable), then keeps watching `img/` while it serves requests. There's no separate "build the index" step.

```python title="api.py"
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    async with syn.runtime():
        _client = qdrant.create_client(pipeline.qdrant_url(), prefer_grpc=True)

        # Start a live update; block until the initial sweep is READY, then run on.
        update_handle = pipeline.app.update(live=True)
        async for snap in update_handle.watch():
            if snap.status is syn.UpdateStatus.READY:
                break
        update_task = asyncio.create_task(update_handle.result())
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            update_task.cancel()


@app.get("/search")
async def search(q: str, limit: int = 5) -> dict:
    query_embedding = pipeline.embed_query(q)               # text → CLIP vector
    results = pipeline._qdrant_search(_client, pipeline.QDRANT_COLLECTION, query_embedding, limit)
    return {"results": [{"filename": (r.payload or {}).get("filename"), "score": r.score} for r in results]}
```

Start the server, then the frontend:

```sh
python -m uvicorn api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

## Search it

The React app posts your query to `/search`, which embeds the text with CLIP and runs a cosine search in Qdrant. Here it is answering *"long neck"* — the giraffe ranks first, then the other animals by visual similarity, none of which was ever tagged with a word:



That's the whole point of a shared image-text space: the match is by *meaning*, not metadata.

## Incremental updates

Because the flow runs live inside the server, the index tracks the folder with no extra work from you:

- **Add an image** — `process_file` runs once for it, embeds it, and upserts one Qdrant point. It's searchable within a second.
- **Replace an image** — same id (derived from the path), new vector; the point is updated in place.
- **Delete an image** — its component disappears and the point is removed from Qdrant.
- **Restart the server** — the initial sweep reconciles against what's already in Qdrant and re-embeds nothing that's unchanged.

Swap the CLIP model and Synor re-embeds everything against the new space; leave it alone and a restart is nearly free.

## Run it

The full, runnable example is in this local workspace: examples/image_search. For higher-fidelity retrieval, image_search_colpali swaps CLIP for the multi-vector ColPali model with Qdrant MaxSim; for the text equivalent, see Semantic Search 101.
